First make DataEngine that is Action, PageObject excel
Then make OR (object repository) to map PageObject and element locators

Put excel(dataengine) in package dataEngine
And put OR in package config

Next create a class Constants in package config

Next create a class ExcelUtils in package utility

Now create methods in ActionKeywords class in config package
Go through the excel and create methods for each ActionWord but dont start writing methods first

And parallely create a DriverScript in package executionEngine
and setExcel, instantiate Object Repository

And then come back to ActionKeywordClass and write the methods

And then write the remaining loop flow in driverscript
