Watch for asserts how they are made

Check out the TestNG annotations. here to change the xml was not required

Watch for the method setup, i directly call the method as it is public and class extends testbase


In SignupTest page, we see that the pop up of signup page is not a child window. it is not another window
The SignupTest page is not necessary to make methods. instead just use the object and call 0the respective methods from
FbSignUpPage(real action). In such case there will be public static void main(String[] args
OR
make the setup method, loadpage method and third method is signupPage() . In this method use the object and call respective
methods from signupPage. this will also do. so testng can be used
